<h1>The 4MC</h1>
<p>My favorite Japanese and Korean Albums of 2016
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/the4MC">@the4mc</a>
<p>It's that time of the year again. Since I listened to a significantly larger amount of Japanese/Korean albums in 2016 than in previous years, I have created a seperate website for these ablums. The total number of albums/eps was well over 100, so I feel confident with the list.</p>
